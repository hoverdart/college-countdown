# Welcome to the College Countdown.

This website, created with Next.js and some plentiful open-sourcing from [armaan](https://armaan.cc), takes data from Applying to College's [Decision Calendar](https://applyingto.college/decision-calendar) for the current year to display colleges and their due dates, as well as a countdown for their due dates.

Be inspired by the inspirational quote at the very top. Double-click any table element to add one of the colleges to your college list, which can be found in the top-right corner. Watch every second tick closer to your decision. And prepare yourself for the inevitable.
